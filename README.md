# P8 Project

## Project
In this project, we address two distinct numerical problems: the evaluation of definite integrals using Riemann sums and the analysis of data download rates from a media server. 

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

### Running the Program:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
#### Set up a virtual environment

First, ensure you have \`virtualenv\` installed:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Then, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment

On Windows, run:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux, run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install required packages

Install all the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
